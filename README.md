## Tech stack
REACTJS, BOOTSTRAP, NODEJS, EXPRESSJS, MONGODB

## Design Choices:

### Why NoSQL in a database?

- We chose NoSQL over a relational architecture because of its own access languages for interpreting data being stored.
- It offers a developer-centric database, which simplifies database design and access to application programming interfaces.
- Before employing databases, developers do not need to be concerned about their internal workings.
- NoSQL databases allow you to work on what you need rather than pushing a schema on the database.

### Why is MongoDB used?

- MongoDB allows different data hierarchies. - Secondary indexes provide for flexibility in datamodel.
- Because Mongo DB is schemaless, we do not define the schema at the outset.

### Why MERN Stack - Performance and User Interface Rendering

- React JS is the best when it comes to UI layer abstraction. Because React is only a library, you may build the application and structure the code anyway you like. As a consequence, in terms of UI rendering and performance, it exceeds Angular.
- Cost-effective
  Because MERN Stack uses only one language throughout, Javascript, a firm will benefit from hiring only Javascript experts rather than specialists for each technology. This choice will save you both time and money.
- Open Source and Free
  MERN employs only open-source technology. This feature allows a developer to use open sources to find answers to challenges that may emerge during development.

## XP Core Values Maintained by Team
- **Simplicity** <br> We made sure to include just the most straightforward solutions that worked. In order for everyone on the team to understand the code and make changes in the future, if necessary, we made it modular and reusable. As much as possible, we have reduced code smells and included pertinent comments to our code. Our code base is straightforward, making maintenance simple.

- **Feedback** <br> We were able to learn, adjust to the adjustments, and prevent repeating mistakes by providing and receiving regular feedback. This encouraged us to work more effectively. We made pull requests and submitted our changes to a branch during the development stage. We pushed the changes to the master branch after another team member gave the code their seal of approval. We ensured that any modifications to the master branch of the code were always stable and did not affect the code of the other team members. We were able to unify our objectives and duties thanks to ongoing feedback.

- **Communication** <br> Our team had good communication throughout the project. We brainstormed the idea of the project initially and divided the tasks among ourselves. We had frequent sprint meetings where we used to dicuss the issues faced by team members and retrospected what did not go well.
